# TICKET.

**Description: A ticket tracker. Currently uses TypeScript, React, Redux. Allows you to view tickets, create tickets. Features simple animations, state management through Redux, and accordian menus. Mainly created this project to practice for an interview.**

**Demo: https://ticket-7199e.web.app Note: It is not responsive currently. Please view on PC with min-width 1251px+.**

# How to use
1. Home Link: View a quick FAQ accordian.
2. Create a ticket: Create a ticket, features tags a thank you modal.
3. View tickets: Nested accordian with color coordinated tags. You can close tickets as well.


# Future scope
1. Not web responsive
2. React-Transition-Group between pages
3. Planning to expand as a fullstack application with Postgre/Node.js.
4. Change Links from React-Router to NavLinks with styling
5. Need to fix the state updates on tags when creating a ticket after sending one.
